# Dockyard: a reincarnation

Implemented with React + Redux, and running
within [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/).

---

## Note

- todo(@stuf): configuration
- todo(@stuf): plugin configuration through `/etc/dockyard.json`

Currently Dockyard does not come with installation mechanisms for
the Pepper Flash Player (required for Kancolle), nor any font assets.

Customisation happens through the configuration files found in `/etc`,
and are somewhat limited at this time.

### PPAPI Flash Plugin

- todo(@stuf): add information about installation from existing Chrome install
- todo(@stuf): http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer.html

## Development

- todo(@stuf): guidelines for development
